### Parse sentences using MeCab

[MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) is a third-party program which uses its own dictionaries and parsing algorithm to decompose sentences into individual words. MeCab may provide more accurate parsing results than Rikaitan's internal parser.

In order for Rikaitan to use it, both MeCab and a native messaging component must be installed.
A setup guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/rikaitan-mecab-installer/blob/master/README.md).
